## Project description

### Project Description: Fairness and Accountability in Task Distribution
<p align="justify">
Task distribution in both households and workplaces is a common source of tension and imbalance, often leading to unequal contributions. One major factor is the invisible mental load - responsibilities like planning, organizing, and remembering tasks - which frequently goes unrecognized and disproportionately falls on certain individuals, especially housewives: While in the workplace, managers are valued for coordinating teams, the same role at home is often overlooked or taken for granted. So, no wonder that - as seen in the TikTok in the lecture - especially invisible mental load manifests particularly in the lives of housewives. However, this issue is not limited to housewives; individuals balancing work, family, and household duties also experience a significant mental burden when others in the household do not contribute equitably.
</p>

#### Key Research Questions:
- Do those who bear the majority of household responsibilities feel their contributions are valued?
- How do others in the household perceive the fairness of task distribution?
- To what extent do those who carry the mental load wish for others to acknowledge their burden or offer help?
- How is accountability managed when someone doesn’t fulfill their responsibilities? Are conflicts around fairness common, and how do households resolve them?
- What apps exist already, that tackle those questions? What makes them good or bad? Do they meet the individual needs and expectations? How can we do better?
- What causes someone to feel overwhelmed? Is self-care being compromised by the workload? Could this be improved through greater fairness in task distribution?

## Needfinding
### Interviews
<p align="justify">
We aimed to interview individuals from different age groups and living situations to gain a comprehensive understanding of mental load and perceptions of fairness in task distribution. We used the given project topic as a starting point for the interview question finding. However, we tried to keep the questions diverse, with potential to find further needs. Our target groups included:
</p>

- **Women**: Since women often bear the brunt of household responsibilities, it was crucial to include their perspectives on how this mental load impacts them and how fairness is perceived in their home environments. We interviewed women from different age groups, since it's possible that the perception of fairness changes with age (which is something we actually had in our findings).

- **Students**: We focused particularly on students living in shared flats (WG), newly independent, or living with a single parent. These living situations often involve high academic workloads and varying degrees of household involvement, making it interesting to explore how fairness in task distribution is perceived and whether they feel a mental burden from balancing academic and household duties.
- **Men**: Including men allowed us to examine how they perceive fairness in household tasks, whether they feel they contribute enough, and how much they are involved in sharing the load. This perspective was valuable in understanding potential gender differences in perceptions of fairness and mental load in shared living environments.

### Affinity Diagrams (V01, V02)
<p align="justify">
In order to identify needs from our interviews, we created an affinity diagram, where everyone put in findings from their interviews. We had frames for Insights, Needs, realizations, Game Changers and Specific Ideas. We recorded the creation process of the first version of our affinity diagram. Below you can see us extracting insights, needs etc. from our interviews and putting them into the corresponding frames. Note that this first version of the affinity diagram was created by only 5 members of the group during a Zoom Meeting. Unfortunately, we didn't find a timeslot at that time which would fit everyone. (We later reflected on that, see <a href="#reflection">Reflection</a>.)
</p>

</p>

<p align="justify">
After creating the first affinity diagram, we realized that many insights and needs could and should be grouped together into different topics and that we had some repetitive findings. We grouped them together by "rough" topics, for example "Tracking" or "Fairness / Recognition". We also recorded the creation process of the second version of our affinity diagram. The process looks a bit messy since a lot gets moved around, but the end product is worth it :)

### Personas
  
|||
|-|-|
| <p align="justify">After completing all the interviews, writing detailed summaries and having our first two versions of the affinity diagram, our group met again to share the insights and needs we identified. We had an open discussion about the types of people who would have the specific needs we encountered, generating many ideas and combining them into three personas. One group member took notes on the blackboard while actively participating in the discussion to ensure everyone stayed on the same page. In the end, we created three personas: a mother balancing family and work (<a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Christine.pdf">Christine</a>), a student excelling academically but struggling with household chores (<a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Ben.pdf">Ben</a>), and a student living in a shared flat who often ends up doing most of the household tasks and wishes for more support (<a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Anna.pdf">Anna</a>).</p> | ![One group member took notes on the blackboard](img/personas/personas_group_gohar.jpeg) |


|Blackboard Sketches|

| <img width=100% src="img/personas/persona_tafel.png"> |
| <img width=100% src="img/personas/persona_tafel_faces.jpg"> |

<p align="justify">
Our final personas had some other characteristics than the initially planned ones since we realized that some characteristics were of no use for the project and were rather overcomplicating the persons description. We chose to preserve the characteristics, that appeared to be essential due to their connection to the identified needs. As you can see, in the second picture we added some faces to the blackboard sketches - these faces will keep popping up throughout the project (next in the storyboards :))
</p>

### Needs

<p align="justify">
We identified a lot of needs. They were documented in our affinity diagrams, but additionally, we also created a list of the needs with some specific quotes from interviews. Note that some of the needs appeared in multiple interviews, we tried filtering down to non-duplicates. <a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/needs_list.pdf">The list</a> can be found in the <a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/">Needfinding</a> folder. 
</p>

## Ideation
### Affinity Diagram (V03)

<p align="justify">
Before starting with the ideation phase, we wanted to make sure that we had a solid overview of our findings so far. Thus, we reorganized the second version of our affinity diagrams, to be better structured as you can see in the following board. The topics were more interconnected after this reworking and one could identify insights-needs-ideas on first sight thanks to the color coding. 
</p>

<img src="img/miro/v03/affinity_v03_full.png">

<p align="justify">
You can access the entire board on <a href = "https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVLVjnktc=/"> Miro</a>. You can also find individual images of the frames in the <a href = "img/miro/v03/"> img/miro/v03</a> folder.
</p>

<p align="justify">
We divided the topics that arose from the affinity diagram to different group members, so each of us could focus on some specific aspects. Then, everyone did desk research to their topics.
</p>

### Desk Research

<p align="justify">
Once everyone was done with desk research, we had another meeting - this time in a room at ETH. We printed out the affinity diagram, cut out the frames, hung them at the blackboard and then took notes. Everyone presented the main points of their desk research, while one group member was taking notes at the blackboard. For every topic, the responsible group member was presenting points, and the note-taking member was adding notes next to that topic on the blackboard.
</p>

<p align="justify">
You can also find individual images of the blackboard parts in the <a href = "img/deskResearch/"> img/deskResearch</a> folder.
</p>

<p align="justify">
We had a variety of sources that we analyzed. On one hand we checked out existing apps and features to learn from negative feedback and to see what users like. On the other hand we analyzed papers and articles to identify potential needs and potential solutions.
You can find a <a href="Deliverables/Ideation/desk_research.pdf">PDF</a> containing all the sources, analyzed in a structured way in the <a href ="Deliverables/Ideation/">Ideation</a> folder.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In one of the interviews, we learnt about an app called "Flatastic", which seemed to tackle a lot of the problems we are looking at. During desk research, we explored the app in much greater detail, since we considered it as an important "competitor".
</p>

#### Flatastic - Most related solution

<p align="justify">
Flatastic targets families and households, offering features such as manual and random task assignments, rotating chores, a point system to encourage participation, and reminders to ensure task completion. It also allows for shared shopping lists and customizable recurring tasks, making it a useful tool for organizing household responsibilities. The app’s visualization tools include color-coded tasks, progress bars, and points displays, fostering friendly competition among household members. However, Flatastic has several gaps that limit its effectiveness in addressing deeper issues of fairness and mental load. For example (naming some features we found to be useful when looking at the needs that we identified), it lacks an anonymous feedback system, any means of visualizing mental load, self-care features for support, and use of AI for suggesting fair task distribution. 
</p>

We downloaded the app and tried it out. Here are some insights:
| <div style="width:150px">Insight</div> | <div style="width:150px">Image</div> |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| The button "hinzufügen" and "abbrechen" are in an unintuitive order (you expect "cancel" to be left). | <img src="img/deskResearch/flatastic/hinzu.jpeg" width="100"> |
| When setting the language to English, not everything gets translated. | <img src="img/deskResearch/flatastic/english.jpeg" width="100"/> |
| It's nice that the app allows you to have a shared shopping list. | <img src="img/deskResearch/flatastic/shoppinglist.jpeg" width="100"/> |
| You can check out statistics of your group members (points based on completed shared tasks). | <img src="img/deskResearch/flatastic/stats.jpeg" width="100"/> |
| You can take over tasks from others. | <img src="img/deskResearch/flatastic/takeover.jpeg" width="100"/> |
| You get positive feedback and points for taking over a task from another user, which we find very motivating. | <img src="img/deskResearch/flatastic/nice.jpeg" width="100"/> |


Looking at feedback from other users: 
- 9 years ago a user mentioned that even if a point system exists, it doesn't allow users to assign different points to tasks. This problem got resolved, the app contains that feature. We learnt from this, that users value having flexibility in assigning difficulty levels to tasks. 
- More recent user feedback also showed, that some of the users feel overwhelmed with the design having too many features. 
- Pricing is another issue, some users feel like it's too expensive. 
- One review showed the need for offline interaction. 
- Another one showed the need to track past tasks which got done. 

These findings will become more relevant at further stages in our project. In the following you can find the feedback mentioned above.

| Original Feedback | Translated Feedback |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| <p align="justify"> Das App ist sehr übersichtlich, schlicht gestaltet •⁠  ⁠Top! Ich vermisse aber wichtige Funktionen wie z.B. die Möglichkeit einstellen zu können, dass die einen Tätigkeiten mehr oder weniger Punkte geben als Andere. «Zeitungen bündeln» sollte anders gewichtet werden können, als z.B. «Bad reinigen». Die einzelnen Aufgaben sollten auch zur Auswahl stehen ohne das ein Termin/ Intervall definiert werden muss, so kann z.B. «Pet-Flaschen zurückbringen» dann erledigt werden, wenn es viele hat u jeder kann sein eigenes Punktekonto so aufbessern ;-) </p> | <p align="justify"> The app is very clear and simply designed •⁠  ⁠Top! But I miss important features, like being able to set certain tasks to be worth more or fewer points than others. "Bundling newspapers" should be weighted differently than "cleaning the bathroom," for example. Tasks should also be selectable without having to define a date/interval, so for example "taking back PET bottles" can be done when there are many, and everyone can improve their points as they see fit ;-) </p> |
| <p align="justify"> Das neue Design ist absolut kontraproduktiv. Früher war die App schön übersichtlich, jetzt überhaupt nicht mehr. Es wirkt vollkommen überladen und unübersichtlich. </p> | <p align="justify"> The new design is completely counterproductive. The app used to be clearly organized, but now it’s not at all. It feels completely cluttered and confusing. </p> |
| <p align="justify"> Komplette Internetabhängigkeit, und keine Interaktionsmöglichkeit, wenn offline. Außerdem einige Bugs in der Oberfläche. Das Schlimmste jedoch Premiumfunktionen, obwohl so oft Werbung gezeigt wird. Grundlegendes wie vor allem eigene Ausgaben zu zeigen und nicht mit Premium zu verbergen, zeugt von schlechtem Stil. Preisgestaltung außerdem viel zu teuer. Das ist eine Studentenapp, was erwartet ihr für eine hohe Bezahlung?! Das Abo ist einfach nur dreist. </p> | <p align="justify"> Complete internet dependence, with no possibility for interaction when offline. Also, there are several bugs in the interface. The worst, however, are premium features, even though ads are shown so often. Basic things like showing your own expenses and not hiding them behind premium show bad style. The pricing is way too expensive. This is a student app—what do you expect with such high prices?! The subscription is simply outrageous. </p> |
| <p align="justify"> Seit dem Update löschen sich die Finanzeiträge von allein und für unseren Geschmack ist die App leider sehr unübersichtlich geworden. Sehr schade, bisher waren wir so zufrieden. </p> | <p align="justify"> Since the update, the financial entries are deleting themselves, and in our opinion, the app has unfortunately become very confusing. It’s a shame, we were so satisfied before. </p> |
| <p align="justify"> Wäre cool, wenn man die Aktivitäten zurückverfolgen könnte. So wäre es für jedermann ersichtlich wer was wann geputzt hat. </p> | <p align="justify"> It would be cool if you could track the activities. That way, everyone could see who cleaned what and when. </p> |


### "How might we" statements
- **How might we** implement a system to record and remind individuals of their commitments, fostering respectful discussions about missed tasks?
- **How might we** help users find the most suitable mental load app, or could we develop an app that customizes features based on individual user needs?
- **How might we** assist people living in shared accommodations (WG) in visualizing the contributions they make to group tasks, thereby raising awareness without making others feel attacked by the feedback?
- **How might we** gradually raise awareness for individuals who value their academic work but sometimes forget about household tasks, while also making the process rewarding?
- **How might we** enhance the mental health of individuals overwhelmed by their mental load - such as those managing family, work, pets, and other responsibilities, and encourage self-care?

### Brainstorming
<img src="img/brainstorming/brainstorm_video.gif" width="100%"/>

|Our approach|Example topic|
|-|-|
|<p align="justify">For our brainstorming session, we followed approach B, where we quietly wrote down our initial thoughts and ideas. To not do some double work, we decided to build our brainstorming on the affinity diagram we had so far. We printed out the individual frames, gave everyone a pen of different color, and physically added our ideas to the large poster. As we had divided the topics between each other in order to do the desk research more focused, each person started with the subtopic they were most familiar with, then switched topics as new ideas emerged, similar to approach A. This process went on for about 20 minutes. After that, a natural discussion began where we combined ideas, built on each other’s thoughts, and refined our concepts. During the process, we followed the motto "there are no bad ideas," actively encouraging other group members to think freely and get creative. By the end, our poster was filled with a wide range of ideas. You can see that some pictures and text are upside down on paper, that was our strategy to allow everyone to write at the same time. You can find more pictures on the brainstorming poster in the <a href="img/brainstorming/">img/brainstorming</a> folder and in <a href="Deliverables/Ideation/brainstorming.pdf/">this PDF file</a>.</p>|<img src="img/brainstorming/brainstorm_example.png" width = "100%"/>|

</p>

<p align="justify">
This is the fourth affinity diagram we created. It includes all the ideas from our brainstorming session, desk research, needfinding, and earlier affinity diagrams, which already contained the important insights and needs from interviews. We created three main columns, one for each persona. In each column, we added User Characteristics extracted from the persona portraits. For each persona, we noted the insights. Then, we grouped needs into a Venn diagram, which allowed us to visualize potentially overlapping needs of the different personas.</p>

<p align="justify">
Since there are other users with needs beyond those of our personas, we added an extra frame for "other users." We did not have way too many points in there, because we designed our personas based on the main identified needs (and our personas have a lot of needs...).

## Low-fidelity Prototype

### Stoyboards

<p align="justify">
We first sketched storyboards on the whiteboard and since none of us are brilliant artists, we decided to have ourselves - as personas - in the storyboards. You can see in the table below how the ideas evolved into actual storyboards.
</p>

**Idea for <a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Anna.pdf">Anna</a>:**
- **Persona**: Anna, who lives with her flatmates and wants more time for herself and her studies, rather than fulfilling household tasks for others.
- **Problem**: Anna is frustrated to feel like "the mother" of the WG. She doesn't like to approach her flatmates directly, to not get into conflicts, so she ends up doing most of the open work herself.
- **Solution**: Our app allows Anna to share her feelings with the others anonymously. Herewith she can avoid the direct confrontation and the others get time to reflect.
- **Payoff**: Over time the awareness of the others increases, they start doing there jobs, Anna feels less obligated to do the job of others and longterm she feels more relaxed and happy with her flatmates.

|Sketch Anna|Storyboard Anna|

|<img src="img/storyboard/storyboard_sketch_Anna.png"/>|<img src="Deliverables/Low-fidelity-prototyping/storyboard_Anna.jpg"/>|

**Idea for <a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Ben.pdf">Ben</a>:**
- **Persona**: Ben, who lives with his wife. He is willing to help out in household, but is more focused on academic success and works down on his to-do list - which is chaotic. 
- **Problem**: The to-do-list doesn't contain any household chores. Although he would want to help, he doesn't even know how and where. And since he is focused on getting his tasks on the to-do list done, he never gets to household anyways. But then, the todo-list he has currently is unstructured, quite messy and has no ordering.
- **Solution**: Our app allows Ben to track household chores, while still keeping track of his academic tasks - and both in an organized and structured manner and in separate lists. He can set priorities (flags) and self-imposed-deadlines. The app optimizes "long to-do-lists" into a 3-item-list. Latter always contains 2 academic tasks and 1 household task. The to-dos that get chosen for this list are based on the priorities he sets and urgency in terms of deadlines. 
- **Payoff**: Over time his awareness of existing household chores increases. He feels more motivated to fulfill some household tasks and it makes him happy to see that he is now able to take over some workload off his wife. Moreover, he now has a structured way to track his tasks and is less overloaded around deadlines.

**Idea for <a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Christine.pdf">Christine</a>:**
- **Persona:** Christine, a teacher balancing her professional life with her role as mother of 3 kids and as a wife.
- **Problem:** Christine feels overwhelmed by the mental load of managing both her work and household responsibilities. Christine has no clear system to track her open tasks, neither at work nor at home. Christine heard of friends using apps to track their tasks, but she doesn’t even know what features in an app she might need to help her, feeling lost with where to start when considering a new app or tool.
- **Solution:** Our app provides Christine with a personalized setup of tools and features that might be useful for her, based on the information she enters at the start through a swiping interaction. By answering a few simple questions, Christine gets customized suggestions, such as a to-do list for tracking her tasks, a calendar to manage her kids’ schedules, and a medicine reminder.
- **Payoff:** Over time, Christine feels less overwhelmed as the app helps her manage her responsibilities at home and work. She gradually feels more in control of her tasks and is finally able to carve out time for herself. This leaves her feeling happier, healthier, and more balanced.

### Paper prototypes

<p align="justify">
We developed many ideas based on the identified needs, which are all listed in our <a href = "img/miro/v04/">Affinity Diagram V04</a>. Many of them were "smaller" ideas that needed to be combined with other concepts to become truly useful. At the same time, we had to be careful not to replicate existing apps. We narrowed down our choices to some specific ideas. It's worth noting that some of these ideas drifted slightly away from the core theme of "Fairness and Accountability Tracking", but they perfectly addressed the identified needs and seemed both realistic and well thought-out.
</p>

- One idea was an app that would allow users to track their tasks, as well as group tasks (e.g., in a shared flat). We were sure to include a system that allowed users to give anonymous feedback to others, as we had identified a need for this: flatmates often want to give feedback or critique but refrain from doing so, ending up completing others’ tasks to avoid conflict. This idea is explored in the <a href = "Deliverables/Low-fidelity-prototyping/storyboard_Anna.jpg">storyboard of Anna</a>, who faces this problem. We also recognized the necessity of incorporating a rewarding system, as our desk research showed that point systems or similar reward mechanisms were highly appreciated and motivating. This app should enable users to track completed tasks, monitor open tasks, assign group tasks to random members (who can choose whether to keep the tasks or not), and reward users for taking on tasks from others. Additionally, everyone should be able to see the workload of their flatmates (both group and individual tasks), allowing them to decide whether they want to help out. This would improve fairness and accountability while facilitating better task tracking.

- Another concept was an app designed for families where the mother (or main household organizer) could distribute tasks, provide instructions, explain the reasoning behind tasks, set deadlines, and reward family members for completing them. This idea addressed the need identified in Interview 2, where the interviewee procrastinated household tasks because they didn't see a clear purpose behind them. They preferred tasks with clear goals. Another interviewee mentioned that although they wanted to help out at home, they were unsure how, which led them to do less. They would appreciate guidance and explanations for tasks. This app would combine all these needs while incorporating a feature allowing users to chat about specific tasks (e.g., in a vacuuming chat, the mother could explain how to do it and why it’s necessary). This would motivate goal-oriented users like Ben by providing instructions and goals, while allowing the mother to distribute her workload. The reward system would further motivate family members.

- A third idea was an app with multiple tools and features, such as a to-do list, a calendar with reminders, a pet management tool, and a kids’ agenda management tool. These features already exist separately, but combining them into one app would make it stand out. We expanded this idea by including personalized views or setups. This meant that the app would configure itself according to the user's specific needs, while still allowing users to add or remove tools later. This idea was ultimately chosen as one of our prototypes (In or Out), and it also appears in the <a href = "Deliverables/Low-fidelity-prototyping/storyboard_Christine.jpg">storyboard of Christine</a> (who didn’t know what features she needed, but the app created a personalized setup that could be adjusted later).
One major feature we decided to include, which we didn’t find in many other apps, was self-care reminders. Through our interviews, we realized that although many interviewees carried heavy mental loads, almost none mentioned self-care. When asked what they did for their well-being, most had difficulty identifying self-care activities. This highlighted a major need: reminders for busy individuals to take care of themselves. As a result, the app would include self-care tips, mental health insights, suggestions for taking breaks, and reminders to prioritize personal well-being.

- Another idea was the concept of a "3-item to-do list." This app was designed for users with a heavy academic workload who want to track their progress and set self-assigned deadlines. It would also help them manage household tasks. The app would allow users to track tasks in multiple to-do lists categorized by topic (e.g., work, studies, household). Users could set deadlines, assign milestone-deadlines, and flag tasks by importance. The app would then filter out the most urgent and important tasks and display 2 academic tasks and 1 household task in a 3-item to-do list. This approach would keep the most pressing tasks front and center while providing an organized structure for managing workloads. The app would benefit procrastinators, those who miss deadlines, and those who want to prioritize tasks efficiently.

<p align="justify">
Although we brainstormed many more ideas, these were the most relevant. It was challenging to choose which ones to develop further, but we ultimately selected the last two ideas. We opted for these because the first two were somewhat similar to existing apps, and the latter two were more convincing from the start. Now, we will describe the paper prototypes in more detail.
</p>

### In or Out: Customized App According to Users’ Needs

<img src="Deliverables/Low-fidelity-prototyping/prototype_in_or_out.gif" />
<a href = "Deliverables/Low-fidelity-prototyping/prototype_in_or_out.mp4">Low-fidelity paper-prototype video</a>

<p align="justify">
This app is designed to provide a personalized experience based on users’ preferences, needs, and characteristics, gathered during the initial setup. It offers several features, including reminders for self-care, visual aids like progress-tracking charts, a pet management tool, a kids’ agenda management tool, and comprehensive to-do lists that are color-coded and prioritized. These features help users stay organized and manage their daily responsibilities while accommodating their unique needs and preferences.
</p>

#### **Features and Functionality:**

1. **Start Page:**
   The app begins by asking users about their preferences through a user-friendly interface. Questions like "Do you want self-care reminders?", "Do you have a pet?", "Do you want visual aids to track progress?", and "Do you need a to-do list?" are presented during the initial setup. Users can answer with a simple swipe left or right, making it easy to customize the app based on individual needs and ensuring a smooth, intuitive experience.

2. **Main Page:**
   The main page displays the options selected by the user during the initial setup, providing a personalized experience. Based on the preferences chosen - whether it’s self-care reminders, pet management, visual aids for tracking progress, or a to-do list - the app ensures that users have quick access to the features most relevant to their needs. This tailored approach helps streamline daily tasks while enhancing usability and convenience.


#### **User Needs and How the App Satisfies Them:**

- **Reduction of Mental Planning:**
   The app reduces mental planning by alleviating the need for users to remember various tasks and responsibilities. Users don’t just enter tasks as a to-do list but can also access specialized tools such as a pet agenda or kids' schedule tracker.

- **Visual Tracking of Progress:**
   Visual aids, such as charts or progress trackers, provide clear representations of tasks and motivate users. The app includes visual aids that display task progress in the form of pie charts, categorizing tasks into completed, ongoing, and not started. This gives users a clear visual overview of their productivity.

- **Self-Care Reminders:**
   Many users neglect self-care while managing their tasks, leading to stress and reduced well-being. The app’s **self-tracker** feature monitors the user’s daily mood over time, encouraging them to prioritize self-care. This feature ensures a balance between responsibilities and personal care, preventing users from overlooking their own well-being amidst a busy schedule.

#### **Addressing Persona Needs (and How We Developed Solutions):**

- **<a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Christine.pdf">Christine</a> - The Stretched Professional:**
    Christine is a working mother with three children and a cat. Despite her demanding job, she manages all household chores, often feeling overwhelmed by the societal expectation that she, as the mother, is responsible for running the household. With all her responsibilities, Christine frequently forgets to make time for herself. The app's **pet management** feature helps Christine track her pet’s needs. The **to-do list** feature assists her in tracking household tasks without relying solely on mental reminders. By organizing tasks by priority, the app alleviates her stress and provides an overview of her responsibilities. The **self-tracker** feature reminds Christine to prioritize self-care and monitor her emotional state. Additionally, as seen in her  <a href = "Deliverables/Low-fidelity-prototyping/storyboard_Christine.jpg">storyboard</a>, she can add new features like a medication reminder whenever she finds a new need.

- **<a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Anna.pdf">Anna</a> - The Organized Overachiever:**
    Anna, a student living in a shared apartment, often takes on more responsibility than her flatmates. She balances academic tasks and home responsibilities, frequently forgetting to set aside time for herself, which leads to stress and burnout. The app’s **to-do list** integrates both household and personal/academic tasks, allowing Anna to manage her responsibilities effectively. The **self-tracker** helps Anna monitor her well-being, encouraging her to prioritize self-care. By providing a structured way to manage her workload, the app helps her avoid burnout while ensuring her tasks are organized and completed efficiently.

- **<a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Ben.pdf">Ben</a> - The Goal-Oriented Procrastinator:**
    Ben is a software engineer and PhD student who lives with his wife. While he is focused on academic success, he often procrastinates household tasks due to a lack of visible goals or deadlines. He struggles to balance work with household responsibilities and feels unmotivated to engage in tasks that don’t have clear outcomes. The app’s **to-do list** helps Ben manage his academic and household tasks separately, allowing him to set priorities and self-imposed deadlines for each. The app's system of visualizing progress and prioritizing urgent tasks helps Ben feel more motivated to take on household responsibilities. The 3-item to-do list, which always includes a household task, allows Ben to make time for house chores while ensuring he doesn't neglect his academic tasks. This structured approach helps Ben balance his personal and professional life while gradually improving his household engagement.


### 3 Steps Ahead: Customized App for Prioritizing Tasks

<img src="Deliverables/Low-fidelity-prototyping/prototype_3_steps_ahead.gif" />
<a href = "Deliverables/Low-fidelity-prototyping/prototype_3_steps_ahead.mp4">Low-fidelity paper-prototype video</a>

<p align="justify">
Our app, "3 Steps Ahead", is designed to help users manage their mental load and organize their daily responsibilities efficiently. "3 Steps Ahead" addresses challenges in task-tracking, having an overview over deadlines, still doing hosuehold chores next to all of that and not being overwhelmed by the to-do list. 
The app is specifically tailored for individuals who struggle with balancing multiple responsibilities across different areas of life. The core design of "3 Steps Ahead" encourages users to break down their to-do lists into manageable steps, using a task prioritization system that helps them focus on their top three tasks for the day. This method fosters a sense of daily progress while minimizing decision fatigue.
</p>
  
#### **Features and Functionality:**
1. **Start Page:**
   The app greets users with a clean start page that introduces them to the "3 Steps Ahead" concept. The simplicity of the interface immediately communicates the app’s goal – to help users stay ahead of their tasks in a clear and manageable way.

2. **Two Key Options:**
   On the next page, users are presented with two options:
   - **"Task Pool"**: This is a comprehensive list of all pending tasks.
   - **"To-do for Today"**: A daily focus list featuring the top three tasks for the day, selected by the app using an algorithm that factors in deadlines, priorities, and user preferences.

   This structure helps users avoid feeling overwhelmed by their full task list, focusing instead on a small, achievable set of priorities for the day.

3. **Task Pool:**
   In the **Task Pool**, users can add tasks in different categories such as:
   - School
   - Work
   - Household

   Each task can be flagged for priority, deadlines, and additional notes, ensuring that users can manage complex to-do lists across different aspects of their lives. This **comprehensive task management** system is flexible and allows users to track all of their responsibilities in one visual repository.

4. **To-Do for Today:**
   The **To-do for Today** section automatically selects the top three tasks for users based on factors like deadlines, priority levels, and user history. This feature is designed to combat **decision fatigue**, by narrowing down the user’s focus to three key tasks. Once these are completed, users receive positive feedback in the form of progress updates, enhancing their sense of accomplishment.

5. **Streak System:**
   Once users complete their three daily tasks, they see a congratulatory **"You’re Done"** page that reinforces positive behavior. Additionally, their task streak updates (e.g., from 1 day to 7 days), encouraging consistency in task completion and productivity. This motivational system enhances the user experience by rewarding continuous effort and creating a habit loop. 

#### **User Needs and How the App Satisfies Them:**

- **Mental Load Reduction:**
   "3 Steps Ahead" helps users reduce their mental load by externalizing task management, meaning that users no longer have to remember everything themselves. The app’s algorithm selects the most critical tasks for each day, reducing the mental effort involved in choosing tasks and freeing up mental space for other decisions. By focusing on the three most important tasks each day, users can offload their cognitive burden and feel more in control of their responsibilities.

- **Structured Task Prioritization:**
   Many individuals struggle with prioritizing tasks across different domains (work, school, home). "3 Steps Ahead" provides a structured way to categorize and prioritize tasks, ensuring that users stay on top of their most important responsibilities. The **Task Pool** and **To-do for Today** sections allow users to organize and focus on urgent tasks, bringing clarity to their daily workload.

- **Motivation and Habit Formation:**
   The app’s **Streak System** creates a habit loop that encourages users to maintain their productivity over time. Positive reinforcement, combined with the simplicity of completing just three tasks a day, builds consistency in task management. The streak system offers a sense of progress and satisfaction, motivating users to continue their productive habits.


#### **Addressing Persona Needs:**

- **<a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Anna.pdf">Anna</a> - The Organized Overachiever**:
   Anna, a student living in a shared apartment, often takes on too much responsibility for household chores and group tasks, leading to stress. She struggles with balancing her academic and household responsibilities, often feeling overburdened by her flatmates’ lack of contribution. The **Task Pool** helps Anna manage both her academic and household tasks in one place, while the **To-do for Today** feature prioritizes the most important tasks. This helps her balance her workload and stay on top of responsibilities without feeling overwhelmed. The streak system encourages her to manage tasks without constant reminders.

- **<a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Ben.pdf">Ben</a> - The Goal-Oriented Procrastinator**:
   Ben, a software engineer and PhD student, procrastinates on household tasks due to a lack of visible goals and deadlines. While he excels in structured academic tasks, he struggles to find motivation for chores without clear outcomes. The **To-do for Today** list gives Ben the structure he needs by setting daily priorities, ensuring household tasks are included. The **Streak System** offers him a sense of progress, while self-imposed deadlines for household chores help Ben balance his academic and household responsibilities more effectively.

- **<a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/Persona_Christine.pdf">Christine</a> - The Stretched Professional**:
   Christine, a working mother, feels overwhelmed by managing both her job and household duties, often juggling tasks in her head without any external help. She needs a solution to reduce her mental load and track her responsibilities more efficiently. "3 Steps Ahead" helps Christine offload her mental to-do list by organizing her tasks into the **Task Pool**, and it selects her top three priorities for the day through **To-do for Today**. This system helps her focus on the most urgent tasks, reducing her cognitive burden and giving her more time to focus on self-care.

## Reflection
**What worked well?**

<p align="justify">
Our team's approach of <strong>silent brainstorming before group discussions</strong>
proved highly effective in generating individual ideas without bias.
This helped foster creativity, especially since no single voice
dominated the conversation. Using an <strong>affinity diagram from desk
research </strong>was a crucial step in <strong>focusing ideation</strong>, which minimized
redundancy and allowed us to organize our ideas systematically. There
were many, many topics we wanted to have a look at. So, for desk
research we decided to split them up. This reduced the workload and
ensured that there was <strong>one specialist per topic </strong>in our group, which
made discussions more informed. A major breakthrough came when we used a
<strong>Venn diagram for need analysis</strong>, as it not only clarified overlaps
but also triggered productive discussions that helped us identify and
prioritize key needs. Additionally, the <strong>physical engagement with large
posters, blackboards, and whiteboards </strong>made brainstorming sessions
dynamic and collaborative. We also realized that <strong>meeting in person</strong>
led to far more effective communication than online sessions, despite
the challenge of scheduling six people. We did one online meeting, but
after that decided to really push for in person meetings. A totally
different experience. Early desk research laid a solid foundation for
persona development, and the <strong>combination of reviewing apps AND
analyzing studies </strong>enriched our understanding of user needs. We feel
like we would have missed important information, if we would have done
only one of the two things. Finally, our <strong>active group chat </strong>and
<strong>shared Google Docs </strong>ensured consistent communication, with everyone
staying on the same page, which made it easier to track progress and
manage tasks collectively. We even had a shared to-do list on one of the
shared documents!
</p>

**What could be improved?**

<p align="justify">
While the <strong>affinity diagram </strong>was helpful, it sometimes became
overwhelming due to its complexity. In hindsight, we could have
segmented it more clearly or limited its scope during the initial
stages. We also realized that <strong>writing down ideas </strong>during meetings was
crucial, as we often forgot valuable insights. This led us to designate
<strong>a person responsible for capturing every to-do/idea,... </strong>during a
meeting, a practice that significantly improved our workflow. At first,
information sharing from desk research wasn't as smooth as we hoped,
which taught us to <strong>plan more time for knowledge exchange </strong>during
meetings. Additionally, meeting preparation was initially a challenge,
as not everyone had their insights ready. We learned that having
<strong>pre-prepared notes</strong> ensured more productive discussions. The
transition from ideation to prototyping felt rushed, and <strong>spending more
time evaluating which ideas were most feasible </strong>could have led to
better sketches. We also struggled with prioritizing features, as we
didn't have a clear metric to evaluate which needs were most urgent.
<strong>Establishing clearer goals at each phase </strong>could have given our
brainstorming sessions more direction. In addition, while personas
guided our designs, we might have <strong>underexplored "other user"
needs</strong>, which would have added value to our ideation process. Lastly,
during brainstorming some sentences started with "I don't know if this
is a good idea/too crazy/...". It got better with time and affirmation,
but after that we thought it would make sense for the future to also
have an <strong>anonymous writing (and maybe even voting) process</strong> <strong>during
brainstorming</strong>, allowing each team member to go crazy.

**What questions do you still have about needfinding, ideation, and
low-fidelity prototypes?**

<p align="justify">
One of our key questions is whether we captured all major pain points
during needfinding or if there are <strong>blind spots we may have missed in
the interviews</strong>. We also wonder if our personas fully reflected the
<strong>diversity of needs </strong>in our target audience or whether we should have
included more varied groups. Another question is <strong>how we might better</strong>
<strong>validate the effectiveness of our low-fidelity prototype</strong> earlier on.
Given the feedback we received, we're curious about what insights we may
have missed from users who prioritize <strong>offline interaction</strong> and how we
could better integrate their needs in future iterations. Additionally,
we questioned whether we should have focused more on <strong>user motivation
and reward mechanisms </strong>during ideation, particularly for engagement
features like point systems. Finally, we are left considering how much
emphasis to place on <strong>aesthetic simplicity versus feature richness</strong>,
especially given the mixed feedback about app complexity.
</p>

**What was intuitive for the users?**

<p align="justify">
Users found certain aspects of the app design intuitive, particularly
the <strong>customization of task difficulty levels through a point system</strong>,
which aligned well with their desire for flexibility in task management.
The <strong>separation of household and academic tasks </strong>was another intuitive
feature, allowing users to prioritize more effectively without feeling
overwhelmed. <strong>Visualizing completed tasks </strong>gave users a sense of
accomplishment and progress. Additionally, the ability to <strong>change
between different lists </strong>- whether academic, household, or children's
tasks - was seen as a simple yet effective way to organize tasks
intuitively.
</p>

**How was your process for prioritizing needs and narrowing down to a
specific idea?**

<p align="justify">
We prioritized needs based on the <strong>frequency of user feedback</strong>,
focusing on common pain points. <strong>Personas </strong>played a crucial role in
this process, guiding us to emphasize features that would be most
relevant for each user type. For example, we concentrated on household
task management for Anna and work-life balance tools for Christine.
Doing that <strong>helped us see where needs frequently overlapped </strong>(really
important!). The <strong>Venn diagram </strong>we used during the process was also
essential for visualizing and discussing these overlapping needs.
Features like flexible point systems were prioritized based on <strong>past
user feedback</strong>, as we knew customization and personalization were
highly valued. We also took guidance from our desk research, which
clarified what we didn't want, such as turning the app into yet another
generic to-do list. When conflicting ideas arose, such as balancing
<strong>aesthetics versus functionality</strong>, we leaned towards solutions that
offered <strong>immediate value </strong>based on user feedback.
</p>

## Mid-fidelity Prototype
<p align="justify">
For the mid-fidelity prototyping phase, we chose to use Figma as our primary design tool due to its collaborative nature and ease of sharing among team members. Figma also offered enhanced animation capabilities, giving us more flexibility to create interactive, engaging prototypes than a tool like PowerPoint would allow.

To maximize efficiency, we divided tasks strategically. Two team members focused on creating each prototype in Figma, handling the main design work and interactions, while the other two team members took on complementary roles. They were responsible for reviewing the prototypes with a fresh perspective, spotting usability issues that might not be apparent to the primary designers. They also prepared targeted questions and a structure for the peer feedback sessions, ensuring that we could gather actionable insights from testers. Regular review sessions kept us aligned and allowed us to incorporate feedback continuously.
</p>

### In and Out
<a href = "https://www.figma.com/proto/ZPj7qWsLyL4o6pXVuNCOIu/In-or-Out?node-id=2228-5138&node-type=canvas&t=M4XaBmjwvSrfulGp-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=1%3A406&starting-point-node-id=2666%3A36577&show-proto-sidebar=1"> Here</a> you can access the figma file of this prototype.

**A bit on motivation**: This prototype primarily focuses on Christine and her specific needs. As a 51-year-old mother of three with limited experience in current technology, our objective is to design an interface that is as user-friendly as possible, facilitating her interaction with the application. Users can not only enter tasks into a basic to-do list, but can also access specialized tools, such as a pet agenda or kids' schedule tracker, ensuring that they stay on top of all aspects of their lives. One of the app’s key features is its use of visual aids to track progress. Users can view their task completion in pie charts that clearly categorize their tasks into “completed,” “ongoing,” and “not started.” This not only provides a visual representation of their productivity but also motivates them to stay on track. Many users overlook self-care when managing their busy schedules. To counteract this, the app includes a self-tracker that allows users to monitor their mood and emotional state over time. The app focuses on reducing decision fatigue between different to-do-list-apps by offering users tailored features related to their to-dos: Users can access specialized lists, such as a pet agenda or a kids’ schedule, if they need/want to, reducing the mental load by presenting a focused set of tasks at any given time.

| Personalization of features | Photo/Video|
|----|----|
| <p align="justify"> The key feature of this app is the swiping process right at the start to figure out the user's needs - even if they don't know it themselves. To facilitate a seamless interaction with the application, we provide a swiping option for responding to questions during the personalization process, allowing users to easily answer with ”yes” or ”no”. In addition to the swiping option, users also have the ability to click on the corresponding buttons to provide their responses. During the personalization process, the number of choices presented to the user is kept optimal to minimize decision-making time, in accordance with Hick’s Law.<br>Based on our needfinding, we decided on the following questions (for now):<br>- Do you have a pet?<br>- Do you study?<br>- Do you work?<br>- Do you have deadlines?<br>- Do you track self-care?<br>- Do you visualize progress?<br><br>We decided that, if this version is chosen based on peer feedback, we’ll refine the questions and feature selection process.<br>(Turns out the other prototype was preferred, but more on that later...)</p>| <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/main-featureselection.gif"  width="250px" /> |


| Showing the user what features were selected | Photo/Video|
|---|---|
| <p align="justify"> After the user answers all the questions either by swiping or by clicking on the buttons, they will reach a page that gives a short walkthrough through the chosen features - but it will do even more. It will propose some features that are probably helpful for you, but were you don't have the awareness yet. For example, when we reflected on our interviews during Ideation we realized, that even though the interviews were about mental load and the effects of that on their lifes, only one interviewee actually started talking about mental health, and more importantly, what to do to improve it, e.g. via self-care. We realized that there was a gap between awareness of the need and the extend of the need. So, we chose to propose the self-care feature, even if the user said he or she does not track self-care at the moment. We added a small text explaining this feature, which we then shorted even more to encourage the user to actually read it. </p> | <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/intro-2-self-care.png"  width="250px"/> |

| Main Page | Photo/Video |
|---------------|----|
| <p align="justify"> Upon completion of the personalization process, the preferred features are displayed on the main page. The start of the app is via swiping, so we decided to also have a similiar mechanism for choosing between the features in the selection of features and we allow users to scroll horizontally to view all available options. The decision to implement a scrolling option rather than displaying all features on a single page is also rooted in our understanding of human short-term memory capacity. Research indicates that the average individual can retain approximately 7 ± 2 items at a time. By utilizing a scrolling mechanism, we aim to minimize the extraneous cognitive load on short-term memory, thereby enhancing user experience and usability. Each feature displayed on the main page is accompanied by a relevant image that visually represents its purpose. To enhance user awareness of the connection between the title and the corresponding image, and to encourage interaction, we have employed the Gestalt principle of common region by enclosing both elements within a shared box. </p> | <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/main-swiping-video-gif.gif"  width="250px" />|

|To-Do and Deadline Pages| Photo/Video|
|---|---|
| <p align="justify"> On the To-Do page, we have implemented a vertical scrolling feature for the same reasons applied on the main page. This design choice aims to reduce cognitive load and enhance user experience by allowing for easier navigation and organization of items. To facilitate task management, the tasks are categorized based on their completion status (open, ongoing, and completed). To enable users to perceive these tasks as cohesive groups, we apply the Gestalt principle of proximity by grouping tasks that have the same completion status together. Additionally, to prevent all tasks from being perceived as a single group, we also employ color coding to exploit the principle of similarity, allowing users to easily distinguish between three distinct groups. The same design pattern is applied on the Deadlines page, where tasks associated with a specific date are displayed in a similar manner. Tasks with the same completion status are grouped together, and tasks with different completion statuses are color-coded to facilitate easy distinction. </p> | <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/features-1-todolist.png"  width="250px" /> |

|My Pets Page|Photo/Video|
|---|---| 
| <p align="justify"> On the Pets page, we have implemented vertical scrolling to further reduce extraneous cognitive load on short-term memory. The Gestalt principle of common region is utilized to effectively chunk relevant information for the user, enhancing information retention in accordance with Miller's memory span. This is achieved by organizing different features (such as vet appointments, vaccinations, and exercise logs) into distinct boxes, thereby facilitating navigation and allowing users to access information more efficiently. Within these boxes, we display the most important user inputs, such as upcoming appointments and vaccinations, while also considering the symmetry principle to enhance visual coherence and user experience. </p> | <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/features-2-pets.png" width="250px"  width="250px" />|

| Changing the selection of features | Photo/Video|
|---|---|
| <p align="justify"> On the main page, the user can also minimize or delete not needed features manually. Those are important choices we made based on our findings during needfinding. We recognized, that users needs are not time invariant, and may change over time, e. g. if they get a pet. To accomodate that, we chose that we make it possible for the user to minimize features (without deleting the data), delete features (which also deletes the data regarding that feature), or to *add* new features. Because user-need-based feature selection is the main focus of this prototype, the only buttons actively showing on the main page are the buttons making those changes possible. The delete-option is the only button where we ask the user if they are sure of their choice, displaying the "Yes, delete this feature" in red, as it signals a warning. </p> | <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/main-minimize-delete-gif.gif" width="250px" style="min-width:250px;max-width:250px;"/> |

### 3 steps ahead
<a href = "https://www.figma.com/proto/NFeSlEoh9S48f4j3Gr310O/Last-version?node-id=1-1092&node-type=frame&t=oZeSh6PLDE2ZE4pj-1&scaling=scale-down&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=45%3A2306&show-proto-sidebar=1 "> Here</a> you can access the figma file of this prototype.

<p align="justify">
<strong> A bit on motivation:</strong> Through our interviews, we discovered that tasks which are repeated over time tend to become easier, as the mental and physical load required decreases. This insight, supported by our desk research, led us to realize that helping users build habits - such as the habit of consistently completing their daily tasks - is key to their long-term success. Establishing routines is crucial because, once a task becomes a habit, it requires less mental energy and effort to complete. Over time, these habits form a solid foundation for productivity, making it easier for users to tackle their to-dos without feeling overwhelmed.
"3 Steps Ahead" is designed to alleviate users’ mental load by externalizing task management. Rather than relying on memory alone, users can offload their responsibilities to the app, which intelligently selects the most critical tasks for each day. This approach reduces the mental effort required to prioritize tasks, freeing up cognitive space for other decisions. By focusing on the three most essential tasks each day, users experience a manageable workload, helping them feel more in control of their responsibilities.
Additionally, many people struggle to balance priorities across various areas of life: work, school, home, and more. The setting where users can decide how many of their daily to-dos should be work- or household-related allows them to slowly get started with habits: E.g. our persona Ben could specify that he wants one household to do every day, slowly builing the habit of helping his wife.
To support ongoing productivity, the app includes a streak system, which encourages users to build lasting habits. By focusing on a straightforward goal - completing just three tasks per day - the app creates a positive reinforcement cycle. This habit loop strengthens users' commitment to task management over time, as the sense of progress and satisfaction from maintaining a streak motivates them to stay consistent. The streak feature also makes it easier for users to develop long-term routines that keep them on track.
</p>

| Your 3 todos of today | Photo/Video|
|---|---|
| <p align="justify"> On the main page of "3 Steps Ahead," you’ll find a simplified view of your entire to-do list, designed to keep you focused on what truly matters. The app automatically selects the most important tasks for the day based on deadlines and priority flags, displaying the top three to-dos (though you can adjust this number as needed). At the top, you’ll see a streak counter that tracks how many consecutive days you’ve completed your daily tasks, adding an element of reward and motivation to keep you engaged. The standout feature of this prototype is its ability to automatically prioritize the 3 (or 1 to 5) most critical tasks, helping reduce decision fatigue and ease the mental load of task management. That is why, when you open the app, these prioritized tasks are the first thing you see, while the full to-do list is intentionally tucked away to avoid feelings of overwhelm. This design choice makes it easy to focus on a manageable daily workload, empowering you to start small and build momentum without being weighed down by the entirety of your to-do list. </p> | <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/3item-mainpage.png"  width="250px"  />

| Different views of the tasks | Photo/Video |
|---|---|
| <p align="justify"> On the "Tasks" page, you can explore various views of your to-dos, such as by category (set when adding a new task) or by completed tasks, if you’d like a sense of accomplishment. This page is designed to encourage users to focus on a more manageable subset of tasks rather than viewing the entire list. In addition, selecting a specific category will initially display only the three most important tasks in that area; users can then choose to view more if needed. The decision to structure this page with category-based views, and to show only a few tasks at first, was rooted in our goal to reduce overwhelm. By making the reduced view the default, we aim to provide an experience that feels organized and achievable. Of course, the full list remains accessible, but the emphasis is on helping users take things step-by-step, avoiding the overload that often comes with seeing every to-do at once. </p> | <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/3item-tasks-gif.gif"  width="250px"  />


| All tasks | Photo/Video |
|---|---|
| <p align="justify"> Both the main page and the tasks page include buttons that allow access to the full to-do list, which is kept intentionally simple and uncluttered. Our goal with this design choice was not to encourage frequent use of the full list but rather to guide users toward the more focused, reduced views - like the category-based lists or, most importantly, the daily to-dos. While the complete list is always available for reference, the emphasis remains on helping users engage with their top priorities. </p> | <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/3item-alltasks.png"  width="250px"  />


| The reward | Photo/Video | Photo/Video |
|----|---|---|
| <p align="justify"> During our needfinding process, we discovered just how motivating a sense of reward is for users. Early on, we decided that no matter what direction we took, rewarding the user would be essential. But the question was: When should rewards be given? We decided that completing daily to-dos would be the perfect moment for positive reinforcement. To keep users motivated day after day, we also added a streak counter that tracks consecutive days of completing daily tasks. To celebrate these achievements, we incorporated an engaging animation that plays each time users complete their daily to-dos, along with the streak counter to create a lasting sense of progress and accomplishment. </p> | <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/3item-reward2.png"  width="250px"/> | <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/3item-reward.png"  width="250px"/> | 


| Settings |  Photo/Video |
|----|---|
| <p align="justify"> A key focus during our needfinding and ideation phases was how to encourage a fairer distribution of household tasks and make it easier for people to get started. To support this, we introduced customizable categories (with options to add or delete as needed) so users can organize tasks by areas like “Household,” “Work,” or "Study.” Users can also decide how many of their daily to-dos should come from each category, helping to ensure a balanced approach to task completion. Additionally, we offer flexibility in the total number of daily to-dos, though with an upper limit to prevent overload. </p> | <img src="img/prototype-walkthrough/3item-settings.png"  width="250px"/> |

### Peer Feedback

#### Tester Overview
All testers from our group and the group numbers of other groups they gave feedback for:
   - Shreeya: gave feedback to Group 16 and Group 29
   - Gohar: gave feedback to Group 30

#### How we conducted the peer feedback exercise session

<p align="justify">
We began with a brief 30-second introduction to set the context. Following this, one team member guided the user through the app, while a second team member observed how well this walkthrough worked with only minimal instructions. This approach allowed us to gauge how intuitive the app felt to users.
</p>

<p align="justify">
At the end of the walkthrough, we asked a series of targeted questions. These included closed-ended questions to clarify specific functionality issues that came up during mid-fidelity prototyping and open-ended questions designed to see if users' perceptions of the app’s purpose aligned with our intentions. For example, we asked them to describe the app in two sentences, allowing us to assess if the app’s core functions and value were clearly conveyed. For finding those questions, one team member conducted a round of desk research to refine the broader, open-ended questions. For instance, the idea to ask users to “describe the app in two sentences” emerged from this research.
</p>

<p align="justify">
In the following, we will provide the instructions used to guide users through the prototype, including the specific behaviors we were observing in their interactions. Additionally, we will outline the questions we asked at the end of each session.

#### Learnings of the peer feedback (summary)
<p align="justify">
In the feedback for the <strong>In and Out</strong> app, testers generally misunderstood the primary purpose of the app as being focused on features themselves rather than on the selection process. This lack of clarity was reflected across multiple areas: for instance, testers did not realize swiping was an option to navigate features, and some were unsure why minimizing features was needed. The iconography and symbols also caused confusion, particularly in the "Features-Todo" section, where the importance indicator ("!") and the status colors (like grey) were unclear. While the main page’s home button was easily found, testers struggled with functionality around task statuses, suggesting drag-and-drop or clearer feedback for changes in status. The visuals, meant to complement the to-do list, didn’t make sense to most testers, because the connection to the to-dos was not clear, with some testers recommending it be integrated into the to-do section directly. Additionally, there was a misunderstanding about "self-care" as a feature, as one tester didn't expect it to include music. Overall, testers recommended clearer navigation, labeling, and more intuitive interactions.</p>

<p align="justify">
Feedback for the <strong>3 Steps Ahead</strong> app showed that testers generally appreciated the simplicity and focus of the app, especially in how it shortlists daily tasks. For the main page, the agreed on wanting the streak to appear much bigger and bolder, and to display completed daily tasks in a different way then not done ones, with some testers wanting them to disappear, move to another page or down, or display a line-through effect when marked as complete. Another cause of confusion was the button “All tasks” vs. the button “Tasks”. There was mixed feedback about the app’s categorization of tasks: while most liked the categories, one tester found them not clear enough. One suggested to also place them on the main page, and anther one to add a category of “Upcoming tasks” or display future to-dos in grey. There was a desire among a majority of the testers for a calendar feature to help view upcoming tasks, and only one tester felt this was unnecessary if the focus is on today's tasks. Testers appreciated the idea of being able to set the number of to-dos, and they suggested improvements to this feature by making it more flexible and easily accessible from the main page. They also felt that while settings were useful, there were too many options and a desire for simpler customization on the settings page.
</p>

<p align="justify">
While <strong>comparing</strong> In and Out and 3 Steps Ahead, testers showed a clear preference for the simplicity of 3 Steps Ahead over the more complex functionality of In and Out. The feedback highlighted that In and Out may benefit from simplifying and clarifying its interface, while 3 Steps Ahead could incorporate some additional options for flexibility without losing its straightforward design. In total, we decided to continue with <strong>3 Steps Ahead for the high-fidelity prototype</strong>.
</p>

##### Goals for the high-fidelity prototype
<p align="justify">
For the high-fidelity prototype development, our goal is to clarify interactions and resolve all sources of confusion highlighted in the peer feedback. This means redesigning how completed daily to-dos are displayed to clearly mark them as done and improving navigation between different views, such as daily to-dos, category-based views, and the complete list of tasks. We also plan on making the streak feature much more prominent and incorporating a calendar option, addressing requests directly from the feedback. Additionally, based on the positive feedback, we’ll retain certain core features: the choice of daily to-dos directly on the main page, the streak display, and the ability for users to set their preferred number of daily to-dos. These features resonated well with testers and will remain as focal points of the user experience. Most pages will undergo a redesign to integrate these changes. So, beyond functionality, we’ll also update the color scheme and adjust button sizes to enhance usability and visual appeal. In particular, we want to soften the intense green, which we recognized could make text hard to read and contribute to visual overwhelm. These updates represent our current vision for the high-fidelity prototype, based on both peer feedback and our own usability observations. However, as we move forward with React development and continue refining the prototype, we recognize that certain decisions may need to adapt.
</p>

### Reflection
#### What worked well?
<p align="justify"> Using Figma as our primary design tool for the mid-fidelity prototypes was an excellent decision. Figma’s collaborative environment allowed multiple team members to work together seamlessly. To manage the workload, we strategically divided the team into smaller groups: two members focused on the Figma designs for each prototype, while the other two took on reviewing tasks. This division ensured that the reviewers had a fresh perspective, helping us catch usability issues that the designers might overlook. Additionally, having two members focus on feedback preparation enabled us to design targeted questions, which helped us gather insightful responses from peer testers. Our approach of conducting regular review sessions allowed us to incorporate feedback incrementally, enhancing the overall quality and usability of the prototypes. </p>


#### What could be improved?
<p align="justify"> One area for improvement would be a clearer process for prioritizing ideas before starting the detailed design work. During this stage, we found that some features could have been validated earlier, which would have prevented certain reworks later in the design phase. While our split-team approach worked well overall, establishing clearer evaluation metrics could have helped us prioritize features more effectively. For example, early usability testing with sketches or wireframes might have identified design pain points sooner. Additionally, several minor but recurring design issues emerged during peer testing, like inconsistent iconography and symbol use, which confused testers. Standardizing design elements before mid-fidelity prototyping might have reduced this confusion and created a more intuitive user experience. </p>

#### What questions do you still have about needfinding, ideation, and low-fidelity prototypes?

<p align="justify"> A key question we still have is whether we captured all relevant user pain points in our initial needfinding, particularly given some unexpected feedback in the peer testing. But we also wonder how representative the peer feedback for the 'In and Out' prototype truly is, as the prototype was designed for a much older generation with very different needs. We are also curious if our personas and scenarios fully represent the diversity of our target audience's needs. Based on feedback, it is still unclear how much complexity users find useful versus overwhelming, as answers from testers were sometimes conflicting. </p>

#### What did not work, and what would you change if you had to do the process again?

<p align="justify"> One area that didn’t work as smoothly as expected was task prioritization within each prototype. Although we had clearly defined personas, we realized some features might have been unnecessary or overly complex, which led to certain usability issues during testing. If we were to repeat the process, we would consider more early user testing to validate and refine these features at a lower fidelity before committing to a full mid-fidelity prototype. Additionally, certain interactions in the prototype, like the swiping and clicking options in "In and Out", were not as intuitive for users as anticipated. If we were to redesign, we might simplify these interactions or provide clearer visual cues for first-time users. </p>

#### What was not intuitive for your users?

<p align="justify"> Several areas of the prototypes proved unintuitive during peer testing. For example, in "In and Out," users didn’t immediately understand the purpose of minimizing features on the main page, nor did they fully grasp the feature-selection process through swiping. In "3 Steps Ahead," the distinction between “All Tasks” and “Tasks” was unclear, and some users wanted a clearer method for completing and categorizing tasks. The feedback also indicated confusion around visual tracking elements in "In and Out," as many testers did not connect them directly to task completion. These observations highlighted areas where further simplification and more intuitive interaction design could greatly improve user experience. Overall, there was much more confusion with the prototype 'In and Out'.</p>

####  How would you evaluate the success of your ideas/project?

<p align="justify"> For the low-fidelity prototype the evaluation was mostly based on if the key feature of the prototype addresses the users' needs. The success of our mid-fidelity prototypes can be evaluated by examining how easily users navigated and interacted with the app, as well as by the relevance and effectiveness of the features we included. Initially, we aimed to create intuitive task management tools with a smooth user experience. Based on peer feedback, it became clear that simplifying navigation and standardizing design elements would enhance usability. Moving forward, our evaluation metrics will focus on users’ ability to complete key tasks efficiently and their satisfaction with the core features. Additionally, we’ll emphasize user understanding of the app’s primary purpose, as feedback showed some testers misunderstood the core functionality, particularly in "In and Out." </p>

## Hi-fidelity Prototype

**In the following we describe the functionality of our prototype.**
| "Home"-page | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screenshot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Screenshot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
| -- | -- | -- |
| <p align="justify"> On the main page called "Home", you'll find an overview of your daily tasks, organized by the categories you’ve selected in the settings. The daily tasks are chosen based on a sorting algorithm that takes e.g. the set importance or due date into consideration. This ensures you see a reduced list rather than the entire long list, helping you focus on what matters most without the burden of filtering tasks manually. From a psychological perspective, this reduces cognitive overload, which occurs when we’re presented with too much information at once, leading to stress or decision fatigue. Thus, the system fosters a sense of control and achievability, which boosts motivation and productivity. <br><br> From this page, you can easily manage your tasks (implemented as the same interactions as on the "All tasks" page): <br> - You can mark tasks as completed directly from this page by clicking the checkbox. <br> - Clicking on a task will open the task page, where you can edit its details. <br> - If you click on a category, you’ll be able to edit it as will be shown later. <br><br> To support user studies that require simulating the passage of time, we’ve included a "Reset for a New Day" button, letting you experience a new day in just a few clicks. </p> | <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/home.PNG" width="250px"/> |  <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/home_progressbar.PNG"  width="250px"/> |

| "Home"-page: The reward | &nbsp;&nbsp;Screenshot&nbsp;Daily&nbsp;Reward&nbsp;&nbsp; | Screenshot&nbsp;Special&nbsp;Reward |
| -- | -- | -- |
| <p align="justify"> The homepage also features a progress bar that shows how many of your daily tasks you’ve completed so far, providing a small but powerful visual reminder of your accomplishments. Once the progress bar is full, meaning you’ve completed all your tasks for the day, you’ll be greeted with a celebratory screen on the homepage. From there, you’ll have the option to start a new day (a feature specifically used during user studies). When you do, your streak will automatically increase by one, and the next day’s tasks will be ready to tackle. <br><br> The homepage also provides an overview of your streaks. You can see your current streak, which tracks the number of consecutive days you’ve successfully completed all your daily tasks. Additionally, your high score - the longest streak you’ve ever achieved - is displayed for motivation. However, there’s a catch: if you miss even a single task, your current streak resets, adding a layer of challenge. <br><br> To make streaks even more rewarding, we’ve included a special reward: Once your streak reaches your personalized streak goal (a target you set in the app’s settings) you’ll unlock an exclusive reward page to celebrate your accomplishment! </p> | <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/home_daily_streak.PNG" width="250px"/> | <img src="img/high-fi/recordings-as-gifs/streak_goal.gif" width="250px"/> <!-- <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/home_streak_goal.PNG" width="250px"/> --> |

| <p align="justify"> On the "All Tasks"-page you are able to access all your tasks. However, they are still classified by category. The goal with this is to have the entire view be less overwhelming. Each task is displayed in a separate box, with a checkbox on the left-hand side of every task. Clicking it allows you to quickly mark the task as completed. Completed tasks will not be shown until specified otherwise, more on that later. On the right-hand side of every task, you’ll see the priority flag you’ve set for the task and any tasks shared with others will display the icons of the other people involved. </p> | <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/alltasks.PNG" width="250px"/> |

| <p align="justify"> When you hit the plus button on the bottom of every page, you’ll have the option to add either a new task or a new category: <!-- </p>  <p align="center"> <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/alltasks_add_new_cropped.PNG" width="250px">  </p> --> To add a task, simply enter a task name; adding a description is optional. You’ll need to select a category and set a priority level. If needed, you can also set a deadline and even share the task with family members. If you decide to share a task with a family member, he/she will get a notification where they can accept or reject this shared task. Depending on the result you'll get a notfication informing you about this decision: <p align="center"> <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/alltasks_sharing_accepted_cropped.PNG" width="200px"/> </p> <p align="justify"> If you want to add a new task, but the appropriate category doesn’t exist yet, no problem: You can create a new category without leaving the task creation process by clicking the "Add Category" button in the category selection menu. <br> When creating a category - either directly from the plus button or through adding a new task - you can customize its color and decide whether to share it with someone else. If you decide to share a category with some of your family members, all tasks added to this category will automatically be shared with all specified people.. </p> | <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/alltasks_add_new_task.PNG" width="250px"/> | <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/alltasks_add_new_category.PNG" width="250px"/> |

Once marked as completed, the task will automatically disappear from your active task list. <br><br> If you ever want to review your completed tasks, you can do so by clicking the icon that appears to the left of the header for each specific category. This will reveal the list of all the tasks you’ve completed within that category. Additionally, if you accidentally mark a task as completed or realize you need to revisit it, no problem: You can simply re-click the checkbox, and the task will be restored to your active task list as uncompleted. </p> | <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/alltasks_completion_after_hidden.PNG" width="250px"/> | <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/alltasks_completion_after_unhidden.PNG" width="250px"/> |


**Additional features on the "All Tasks"-page:**
- <p align="justify"> For each category, you can choose an individual sorting. You can click on the sorting icon on the right of the category header and you can decide if you want to sort by priority, by deadline or by shared with most people. In the pictures below, we sorted the household category that was sorted by priority now by shared with most people. </p>

- <p align="justify"> When you click on a task item a page opens where you can edit the task. You can change anything that is also available when adding a new task. There is a button at the top right of this page which allows you to delete this task from the list. This was also important in the user study as the users were asked to - among other things - delete tasks. </p>

- <p align="justify"> On the "All Tasks"-page there is also a menu button in the top-right corner. Clicking it reveals four options to help you manage your tasks more effectively. One of these is Edit Categories, which allows you to customize or update your task categories. When you choose to edit categories, you’ll be taken to a dedicated page where you can manage all your categories. By clicking on a category or the accompanying pencil icon, you can adjust any settings you initially configured, such as the category name, color, or sharing preferences. You also have the option to delete a category, which will automatically remove all tasks associated with it. Another option, Generate Sample Tasks, was specifically designed for user studies, enabling the creation of simple tasks to populate the app when starting fresh. Additionally, the Clear Completed Tasks option deletes all completed tasks for you, cleaning up your to-do list if you have the view of completed tasks enabled. If you'd like to show all completed tasks for all categories, you can click on the Show All Completed Tasks option. If you’ve chosen to display them, the text will change to "Hide All Completed Task". Clicking this will hide all completed tasks for you. </p>

**Visuals**
<p align="justify"> On the Visual Page, you’ll find a Completed Tasks Per Day diagram, where you can track how many tasks you've completed each day. This allows you to visualize your productivity trends over time. You can toggle between two viewing options: Weekly View, which shows the data for the past seven days, or Monthly View, which displays your task completion history for the last 30 days. </p>

<p align="justify"> In the Task Completion Rates Diagram, you can see the percentage of tasks completed for each category. The colors used in the diagram perfectly match the colors of your categories, ensuring a visually cohesive experience that makes it easy to associate data with the corresponding tasks. This diagram provides a clear, at-a-glance view of your progress across different categories.<br> By sliding to the right, you can access the Open Tasks Per Category diagram, which gives a numeric breakdown of how many tasks remain open in each category. This helps you identify which categories may require more attention in the coming days, allowing you to plan ahead and manage your time more effectively. </p>
<p align="center"> <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/visuals_2_1.png" width="250px"/> <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/visuals_2_2.PNG" width="250px"/></p>

<p align="justify"> If you scroll down, you’ll see a breakdown of the tasks you’re sharing with each individual family member. For example, you can view how many tasks are assigned to your husband, daughter, and son, e.g., 2 tasks with your husband, 5 with your daughter, and 2 with your son. This view allows you to quickly identify where you might be able to delegate more tasks to balance the workload. On the next slide, you’ll find the Task Distribution for your family. This shows, by category, how many tasks each family member is currently managing. You can choose to enable or disable the display of specific categories, so you can customize your view based on what’s most relevant to you. Finally, on the last visual screen, you’ll see a Mental Load chart for your family, which illustrates the number of tasks each person currently has assigned in their app. This visual representation helps you assess the overall distribution of tasks and ensures that no one is overwhelmed while also giving you insight into where you might need to adjust the workload. </p>

| <p align="justify"> *Tasks per Day:* <br> You have full control over how many tasks you want to tackle each day, both overall and within specific categories. In the settings, you can set a daily task limit ranging from one to five tasks. We’ve capped the limit at five to help users avoid burnout and maintain a healthy balance. <br><br> *Category limits:* <br> You can then allocate these tasks across your chosen categories, ensuring the total matches your daily task limit. To ensure this, the values you can select for each category depend on how many tasks are still available. For example, if your daily task limit is three and you allocate two tasks to the "Work" category, the only remaining options for "Household" would be 0 or 1. This system prevents over-allocation and keeps your task distribution balanced. To make adjustments easier, there’s a reset button that sets all category limits to zero, allowing you to redistribute them as needed. <br><br> *Streak settings:* <br> Additionally, you can customize your streak settings. By default, streak tracking is enabled, with a streak goal set at two consecutive days. However, you can adjust this goal to challenge yourself further. The streak goal plays a key role in maintaining motivation: Once you reach it, you’ll be greeted with a congratulation, celebrating your success and encouraging you to keep your streak alive.</p> | <img src="img/high-fi/screenshots/settings_empty_example.PNG" width="250px"/> |

### Motivation for this prototype (Important)
**In the following we reflect on how our finding from the needfinding process come through in our ideation with personas and brainstorming and how they manifested in our final app.**
(The following citations are from our interviews, you can refer to the <a href="Deliverables/Needfinding/needs_list.pdf">needs list</a> from Needfinding as well.)

<p align="center"><i>"If I do not have clear deadlines or no reward is waiting for me I will procrastinate my task."</i> </p>
<p align="justify"> During the needfinding and ideation phase, we quickly realized that procrastination is a problem for people of all ages and independent of profession. One big reason for procrastination were tasks without strict deadlines, things as household chores. That’s why we gave Ben, one of our personas, this exact struggle. We also found another major cause of procrastination: decision fatigue. When people have a lot on their to-do list, they lose track of everything, get overwhelmed, and start procrastinating even more. Ben deals with this too. He keeps track of his academic tasks on a paper to-do list, but it always ends up messy and unorganized, making him feel even more stressed, especially because it leads to him having to do things last minute.<br> To help people like Ben, we decided to focus on simplifying their daily tasks. The app shows a reduced view of your to-dos so you don’t feel overwhelmed by a huge list (addressing the decision fatigue). We also let users choose how many daily tasks should come from each category. For example, if Ben wants to stop putting off household chores, he can set it so that one of his daily tasks is always from the "Household" category (addressing procrastination because of tasks without strict deadlines). That way, he’ll be encouraged into doing (at least) one household chore every day.<br>On top of that, we added reward and gamification elements to make finishing tasks more fun. The idea is that over time, these features help people build a habit of not procrastinating and make even the boring stuff feel a little more rewarding.</p>

<p align="center"><i>"In every group project, I end up doing most of the work because others don’t engage as much. It’s exhausting. I rather work alone."</i> Another interviewee: <i>"I’m tired of constantly reminding everyone to do their chores. If we had a system that assigned tasks and reminded people, it would make things so much easier." </i> </p>
<p align="justify">A recurring theme we heard in our interviews was that people often preferred working alone because, in group projects, they felt like they were doing most of the work. And they weren’t alone in feeling this way, many shared the same frustration. Take our persona, Anna, for example: She lives in a shared flat and often feels like she's doing most of the organizing and has to remind others constantly such that the tasks assigned to them actually get done, much like Christine. One key reason for this is that others often don't realize they're not pulling their weight. This is where our solution comes in: raising awareness within the group. We wanted to create a way for everyone to see how much they’re contributing. Our solution? To literally show them! We designed a visual representation that breaks down the workload by person. With our app, you can quickly create a shared category and invite others to join. With the shared categories feature, Anna no longer has to manually assign tasks to everyone. Instead, all tasks are automatically shared. In addition, users can easily see how many tasks they are responsible for compared to their teammates. From there, you’ll always be able to see the progress others are making. No more chasing people down.<br>Looking ahead, we’re planning to add notifications that alert users when their share of tasks falls below a certain percentage or when they’re taking on too much. This will ensure a fairer workload balance without the need for constant manual tracking.</p>

<p align="center"><i>"It’s hard when you put in all this effort, and no one seems to notice. I kind of got used to doing the things and I feel like if I would stop doing them people would be mad at me. But at the same time, I feel like they don’t appreciate it enough. So, I don’t know what the right way to go is."</i></p>
<p align="justify">In group projects, the person doing most of the work often feels unappreciated, as their efforts go unnoticed. This is something many people experience, but during our interviews with mothers, we realized it’s especially common in family settings. Many mothers - and women in general - end up taking on a large amount of unpaid, invisible work. Over time, they stop asking for recognition because nothing ever changes. This was reflected in our persona, Christine, who was constantly doing things for others without feeling appreciated, and eventually lost herself in the process. This is where our reward system and visuals come into play. The daily rewards and special rewards for achieving personal goals serve as a substitute for some of the appreciation that’s often missing. The visuals help Christine recognize her own achievements - whether it’s seeing how much she’s completed over the past week or month or watching her streak grow. These things encourage her to feel proud of her progress. Moreover, the visuals showing the breakdown of tasks between Christine and others (e.g., in the household category) provide a way for her to bring attention to the issue with her family. For example, she can use the data to show her husband how much she’s doing and start a conversation about sharing the load more fairly. Looking ahead, we’re also thinking about adding gentle reminders, like “Check out the distribution in visuals” or “When was the last time you said thank you?”</p>

<p align="center"><i>"It’s hard to know if I’m actually making progress when I’m constantly busy. Seeing what I’ve accomplished would motivate me to keep going."</i></p>
<p align="justify">This statement is something we heard in our interviews as well. It relates to the statement above but here it speaks to the idea of recognizing and appreciating our own progress - not waiting for others to acknowledge it. Reflecting on the conversations in our interview process, we realized just how important self-appreciation is, and how often it's overlooked. Interestingly, only one interviewee brought up self-care on her own when discussing how she manages her mental load. Most of the others admitted to struggling with being proud of themselves, always feeling like there was more to do, and sometimes feeling like they hadn't accomplished anything - even when, in reality, they'd done a lot. This is especially true for tasks that are often invisible, like organizing or planning, where there is no tangible proof of your efforts. From our personas, both Anna and Christine do not take enough time for themselves and their hobbies. That’s where our reward system and visual progress tracking come in again. With daily rewards and a visual representation of what you’ve accomplished, you get that much-needed acknowledgement, even if it doesn’t come from others. Seeing your streak grow, your completed tasks stacking up, and the progress bar filling in provides a visual cue that yes, you have accomplished something. Note that if you have completed your daily tasks, the Home page stays clear and only shows a congratulations screen until the next day. You are done - no more tasks.</p>

**In the following we reflect on which changes to the mid-fidelity prototype were made while developing the high-fidelity prototype based on the peer feedback.**
<p align="justify"> After reviewing the feedback from our mid-fidelity prototype, we made several changes to improve the 3 Steps Ahead app based on tester insights. One of the key points was the desire to make the streak feature more prominent. Thus, we’ve enlarged the streak display and included it on the Visuals page as well. Testers also felt that completed tasks should be visually more distinct from incomplete ones. To address this, we’ve made that completed tasks automatically disappear from the lists. Users can still access them, but they need to press a dedicated button. To clarify navigation, we renamed the "Tasks" page to "Home", for a clearer distinction from the "All Tasks" page. Because most testers already liked the categories how they were, suggestions like displaying future tasks in grey or adding an "Upcoming Tasks" section were noted for future consideration. There was a strong request for a calendar feature. While we noted the demand, we’ve kept the app’s primary focus on daily tasks for simplicity. Finally, testers found the settings page overwhelming, with too many options. In response, we’ve drastically reduced the number of settings while maintaining key customization features.</p>

### The alternative: Box view
<p align=center> <img src="img/high-fi/recordings-as-gifs/list_view_actions.gif" width="250px"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src="img/high-fi/recordings-as-gifs/box_view_actions.gif" width="250px"/> </p>
<p align=justify> In the Box View, tasks are no longer displayed as a vertical list but instead as individual boxes arranged side by side. This layout provides a more dynamic and visually engaging way to manage your tasks. To complete a task, you no longer click a checkbox: Instead, you simply swipe left. If you want to delete a task, swipe up to the right, and a confirmation prompt will appear to ensure you really want to delete it. <br> While the layout differs, other functionalities remain the same. The homepage still displays your daily tasks, but now as boxes instead of a list. You can still sort tasks, edit them by clicking on them, and manage everything just as you would in the list view. </p>

## User study

</p>


<p align="justify">
The user study compared two versions of the "3 Steps Ahead" mobile app, designed to improve task management and reduce cognitive overload. Version A used traditional clickable interactions for completing and deleting tasks, while Version B employed swipe gestures. The study evaluated user performance through metrics such as task completion time, error rates, and workload (using NASA-TLX dimensions). Participants were chosen using convenience sampling. </p>

<p align="justify">
No statistically significant differences were observed in overall task completion time or error rates between the two versions. Also, both versions had similar NASA-TLX scores across mental, physical, and temporal demand, as well as performance, effort, and frustration, indicating comparable user experiences. However, overall Version B had higher (and thus worse) medians across all NASA-TLX metrics, indicating higher user satisfaction for Version A. No significant differences were found between task deletion intuitiveness and task opening intuitiveness. However, Version A was found to be significantly more intuitive for task completion. Positive emotions such as excitement and satisfaction were frequently reported across both app versions. However, frustration and confusion also emerged, especially in tasks involving the "box view" layout in Version B. </p>

<p align="justify">
The two interaction methods yielded similar outcomes in terms of efficiency and user satisfaction. However, a larger sample size might uncover more subtle differences. </p>


## Reflection 

#### What worked well?
<p align=justify>
Working on this project milestone was a rewarding experience as we were finally seeing our app. From the very beginning of working on this milestone, we divided responsibilities to make the process manageable and efficient (a learning from the previous milestones). One person took charge of all the coding, another focused on writing the blog to document our progress (hey thats me!), and a third created the user study protocol. For the user study itself, three team members were actively involved in conducting it, while two others were reserved for pilot testing - one of them testing an earlier stage of the app to provide fresh feedback. This clear division of roles worked well for the most part. Having a single person dedicated to coding ensured consistency and made it easier to track changes. The user study protocol was well-prepared, which helped us gather structured feedback during testing. The blog writer ensured that we had a clear record of each stage of development and also took on organising roles as they had the clearest big picture, which helped us move together as a group. Saving two people for pilot testing was also a smart decision, as their unbiased perspectives helped us catch issues that the rest of us might have missed after being too immersed in the project. </p>

#### What could be improved?
<p align=justify> A big part of this milestone was coding. Not everything went according to plan, which is probably just a normal part of working on any coding project, but it definitely added stress. At times, we worried about meeting our self-imposed deadlines (we did not always manage to do so). One particularly tricky task was implementing the alternative view for our user study, the “box view,” with its swiping functionality. What seemed simple at first turned out to be a big hurdle, causing major layout issues that took way longer to fix than expected. These delays meant we sometimes had to change our plan, but they taught us valuable lessons about planning for the unexpected. For the user study, we struggled a bit with choosing the right test and how to bring the data to life as this was our first time conducting a study. We also recognized that some of the questions for the NASA-TLX part were not entirely clear to the testers in the google questionnaire. In the future, we would make this more clear for people seeing the questions for the first time.</p>

#### What questions do you still have about user studies and high-fidelity prototypes?
<p align=justify>
Even though we learned a lot, there are still a few things we are curious about. One of the biggest is how representative our findings from the user study actually are. On the surface, our needfinding phase felt comprehensive - interviewing around 10 people gave us a solid overview of user needs. But when it came to the user study, we couldn’t replicate the same diversity in terms of age and profession. The main issue was that user testing had to be done in person. This made it difficult for most of us, as international students, to involve a wider variety of participants, like older family members or working professionals outside of our immediate circles. Only one person in our group could test with their parents, which meant our pool leaned heavily towards younger participants, particularly students. This leaves us wondering: did we miss out on important insights that could have come from older or non-student users? And how might those perspectives have changed the direction of our designs? </p>

#### General reflection of the one iteration of the UCD cycle
##### What worked well and what did not
<p align=justify>
Following the approaches we learned in the lecture was super helpful because they gave us clear steps to follow and the structure we needed to stay on track. Especially conducting multiple interviews or creating affinity diagrams played a big role in our root-cause analysis. <br> Overall, our team worked really well together, and we developed a good habit of sharing ideas freely, even if those ideas didn’t end up being used. However, one major takeaway for us was how much more effective in-person meetings are compared to online ones. For example, something simple like doing a poll and reminding everyone to fill it out, which could take days online, can be done in just a minute during an in-person meeting. Plus, sharing ideas face-to-face allowed us to get quick feedback and have more dynamic discussions, which as everyone was physically there and listening kept everyone on the same page.
Lastly, we found personas extremely helpful because they saved us from constantly revisiting all the raw data from our needfinding. Instead, we could focus on the specific needs of our personas. This also made it easier for us to evaluate feature ideas, because personal feelings were always biased by our own needs. With the personas, our discussion and decisions were based on more objective reasons. We’d definitely use personas again in future projects and keep them front and centre during prototyping to make sure our designs stay user-focused.<br> That said, we did face some challenges, especially with time management. Even though we started early, we often felt under pressure, particularly when transitioning from ideation to prototyping. During ideation, we worked hard to extract user needs and insights and organize them into personas, but managing such a massive amount of data was tough. Our affinity diagram became overwhelming, especially with six people working on it simultaneously in Miro. It was easy to get lost in the details, and in hindsight, we should have done that session in person (unfortunately at the time meeting online was the only possible option for that meeting) using sticky notes, which would have made it more manageable and collaborative.<br> We also felt rushed when it came to selecting which ideas to prototype. This pressure led us to quickly settle on three low-fidelity prototypes, which, looking back, may not have been the best ones we could have chosen given the insights we had. The brainstorming phase was challenging as well. We felt the weight of trying to come up with something new and competitive, especially knowing that established companies have been refining their products for years. Peer feedback sessions, while helpful, were sometimes disheartening when testers compared our prototype ‘In and Out’ to big platforms like Notion. And the coding has its own set of hurdles too.
</p>

##### Which role had UCD? How did it affect our result? What will we apply in the real world? And what limitations do we see?
<p align=justify>
One of the biggest takeaways from this project and the one iteration of the UCD cycle was just how crucial testing and user feedback are. During the peer feedback phase, we were convinced that everyone would prefer the ‘In and Out’ prototype. To our surprise, <i>every single tester</i> favored ‘3 Steps Ahead.’ A similar situation occurred during the user study: we assumed the list view would be the clear favourite, but the results were split 50/50. Interestingly, some participants who preferred the box view admitted they’d probably switch to the list view long-term, but the fact that opinions were so divided caught us off guard. These unexpected results highlighted how much our own biases and the "curse of knowledge/expertise" had influenced our expectations. This was a humbling moment and a clear sign that we had underestimated the importance of testing to challenge those biases. With this, we also learned how valuable the "speed of creation" is when it comes to prototypes. The faster you can put a prototype in front of users, the quicker you can gather real, empirical data to guide your decisions. Early on, we underestimated how critical this would be. Thus, we are sure that this one iteration of the UCD cycle significantly improved our final app. <br> In a real-world context we would remember mainly the three following things: First, and foremost, testing early and often. Prototypes don’t need to be perfect before you seek user feedback; what matters is getting something in front of users quickly to gather empirical data. We would pay attention to doing fast iteration cycles of the UCD cycle. Second, we will carry a heightened awareness of our biases. The "curse of knowledge" is a real challenge, especially if you design every part of the app yourself. In this context falls also our third point that we will remember in real-world contexts: Creating personas. The use of personas proved incredibly effective in keeping user needs front and centre throughout the project. <br> While UCD was instrumental in our success, it also revealed some limitations: One of the biggest challenges is the time-intensive nature of the process. Each iteration requires significant time and effort. In fast-paced environments or under tight deadlines, it might not always be feasible to complete multiple iterations, sometimes even one complete iteration. Another limitation is the reliance on the available user pool. For example, our user study was constrained by who we could meet, which meant our sample lacked diversity, particularly in age and profession. This can skew results and limit the generalizability of the findings. In real-world applications, it will be crucial to ensure broader and more diverse user representation, even if it requires additional resources or creative solutions like remote testing. Lastly, do we always want to create a product that appeals to the largest number of people? Sometimes, it might be better to focus on a more niche product that serves a specific group of users well, even if it doesn't work as well for others. We believe that the broader your target audience, the harder it becomes to truly satisfy everyone, even in the best-case scenario. </p>
